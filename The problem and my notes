# Build a roman numerals program
Arabic number - 1 to 10
Convert to roman numerals

User story, objects (nouns) and messages (verbs) - breaking the problem down
Feature test in irb? Not necessarily needed for this complexity

Strict TDD:
Require a file that doesn't exist then get the error to say it doesn't exist - I jumped to creating the file already


Breaking down the problem
User story:
As a person
I want to be able to convert an Arabic number to a roman numeral
So that I can converse with the romans

Objects - Person, number
Messages - convert (display)

Need to perform a conversion on a number and transform it into a roman numeral
Need to limit it to the numbers 1 to 10
Need to test each number

Still need to break the problem down further - what is the simplest thing you could look at?
Zero - first step. Then look at the I's? Then the non-I's?
Think about return values - always return a string?

If I stuck to test driving properly, would go to I * number (for 1 to 3), then start to build in more rules

Lessons: Step away from the code, break the problem down, look for patterns, write the simplest test and the simplest code to pass the test
